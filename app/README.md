# App

A simple FE application for showing different cities and their pictues.

## Prerequisites

- [Angular CLI 15.2.3](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli)
- [Node 18.15.0](https://nodejs.org/en)

## Running locally

1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `ng serve --open` to start the development server with hot reloading (the option `--open` opens your browsers with the correct URL already)

## Code scaffolding

- Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`
- As a side note - the project has also been bootstrapped with [Angular material](https://material.angular.io/)

## Running unit tests (via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io))

- Run `ng test`

## Running end-to-end tests

- Run `ng e2e` (note this can only be executed if a package is added which implements end-to-end testing capabilites - currently it doesn't work)

## Building for production

- Run `ng build`
- Copy the created `dist/` folder's content to the webserver of your choosing
